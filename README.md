# Comprehensive-Machine-Learning-Techniques-for-Breast-Cancer-Classification
This project is a quintessential demonstration of diverse machine learning competencies applied to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. It meticulously integrates a spectrum of learning methodologies, including supervised learning with L1-penalized SVM, innovative semi-supervised/self-training techniques, and unsupervised learning through k-means and spectral clustering. Each method is rigorously evaluated using Monte-Carlo Simulation to assess its efficacy, employing metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC. This endeavor not only exhibits proficiency in handling intricate medical datasets but also illuminates a profound understanding of multifaceted machine learning paradigms. Its comprehensive approach and insightful analysis make it a distinctive and valuable asset in any data science or analysis portfolio, particularly for those aspiring to make impactful contributions in healthcare analytics.
