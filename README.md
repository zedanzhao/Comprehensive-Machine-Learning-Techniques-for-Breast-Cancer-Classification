# Comprehensive-Machine-Learning-Techniques-for-Breast-Cancer-Classification
This is an exemplary project designed to demonstrate a wide range of machine learning skills. It involves the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set and applies various learning methodologies: supervised learning with L1-penalized SVM, semi-supervised learning/self-training, unsupervised learning with k-means and spectral clustering. Each method undergoes Monte-Carlo Simulation to validate its effectiveness through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC. This project not only showcases the ability to handle complex medical datasets but also reflects a deep understanding of different machine learning paradigms, making it a standout addition to a portfolio for roles in data science or analysis.
